This repository contains my work with LangSmith, a developer platform for building, testing, and monitoring applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

With LangSmith, I explored:

ðŸ”Ž Tracing â€“ tracking LLM chains and agents step by step.

ðŸ“Š Evaluation â€“ testing prompts and comparing outputs.

âš¡ Debugging â€“ identifying bottlenecks and optimizing performance.

ðŸ§© Integration â€“ using LangChain with LangSmith for seamless workflow management.

This project demonstrates how to design, test, and improve AI-powered workflows efficiently using LangSmith.
